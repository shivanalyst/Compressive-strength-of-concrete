# Compressive-strength-of-concrete

Concrete is one of the most used materials in buildings today; yet, predicting the accurate concrete compressive strength remains challenging because of the highly complex relationship between its mixtures. Strength of the concrete mixture mainly depends on cement, slag, ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, fine aggregate and age.

The traditional methods have so many shortcomings, including expensive experimental costs and the inability to formulate an accurate complex relationship between the components of a concrete mixture with the compressive strength. To overcome this issue, this study applies multiple artificial intelligence (AI) methods to find the most accurate input and output relationships within concrete mixtures.

This study uses 1030 data samples from concrete compressive strength tests obtained to demonstrate the use of AI prediction models. The obtained results of the simulation show that these artificial intelligence methods can build predictive models without conducting any expensive experiments in the laboratory with good accuracy.
